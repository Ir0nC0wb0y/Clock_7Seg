# Clock_7Seg
 7 Segment Clock

The hardware of this clock is based on the "Thing" at:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2947883

I did not want to sign up for all the accounts and utilize all the API's of that implementation. In addition, I've been wanting to work through the code of a clock (including NTP and even animations). I may end up utilizing some of his code eventually (the web interface is really slick).
